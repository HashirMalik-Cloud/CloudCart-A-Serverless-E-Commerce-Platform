CloudCart ‚Äì A Serverless E-Commerce Platform  

Welcome to **CloudCart**, a modern serverless e-commerce application built on **AWS Amplify** and related cloud services.  
This project demonstrates how a fully functional online store can be designed, deployed, and scaled without managing traditional servers.

- User-friendly frontend built with **Next.js** (React framework)  
- Secure authentication and user management powered by **Amazon Cognito**  
- Product listings and purchases stored in **DynamoDB**  
- Image/file uploads to **Amazon S3** with presigned URLs  
- Secure payments integration with Stripe (via API Gateway + Lambda)  
- Scalable hosting and CI/CD through **Amplify Hosting**

## üõ†Ô∏è Architecture & Services Used  

Here‚Äôs a breakdown of what powers CloudCart:  

1. Amplify CLI & Hosting: 
   - Used to bootstrap and manage all cloud resources.  
   - Hosts the frontend app with automatic builds and deployments.  

2. Amazon Cognito (Authentication):  
   - Handles signup, login, and secure session management for users.  
   - Provides authentication tokens to access protected resources.  

3. Amazon DynamoDB (Database): 
   - Stores product information, user orders, and purchase history.  
   - Serverless, highly scalable, and fast NoSQL database.  

4. Amazon S3 (Storage): 
   - Used for storing product images and user-uploaded content.  
   - Access controlled with **presigned URLs**, ensuring security.  

5. AWS Lambda (Serverless Functions):  
   - Powers backend logic such as payment handling, order verification, and database updates.  
   - Example: Verifies Stripe webhook signatures, updates DynamoDB, and generates S3 URLs.  

6. Amazon API Gateway (API Layer): 
   - Connects frontend with backend Lambda functions.  
   - Provides REST endpoints for payments, file uploads, and order management.  

7. Stripe (Payments): 
   - Integrated securely with Lambda for handling transactions.
